# Flatabulous

This is a Flat theme for Ubuntu and other debian based Linux Systems.  This is based on a the Ultra-Flat theme. Special thanks to @steftrikia and Satyajit Sahoo for the original work.

# Installation

## Update
Install it manually, if you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher. If you prefer the `.deb` installers, please download the correct one, based on the version from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases).


This theme was designed *specially* for the Unity environment on Ubuntu as I have only tested it on Ubuntu. It might not work properly for the other versions.

*The terminal*


To install the theme, you must first install the [**Ubuntu tweak tool**](http://ubuntu-tweak.com/). It can be installed by simply running the command :

```
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak
```

## Update 
If you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher, run the commands below to install Ubuntu Tweak:
```
wget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu xenial-getdeb apps" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak
```

or heading over to their website, downloading the .deb file (recommended).

## 1. Using the .deb file for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives (Recommended)

Download the .deb file from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases/latest), double click to open with Ubuntu Software Center and click on install. Than install the theme using ubuntu-tweak.


## 2. Using the noobslab PPA

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flatabulous-theme
```

## 3. Manually

Download the source to the theme [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/archive/master.zip). If some problem ossurs with your installation, kindly download the correct version based on your version of Ubuntu from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases). If you are a developer or a designer, I also encourage you to contribute to it. Create a folder, called .theme in your home directory. This can be simply created by firing up your terminal, and then running

`mkdir .themes`

Now this is a hidden directory, to view this in Nautilus, you can press `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + H`. Alternatively, you can also place the extracted files in your `/usr/share/themes/` folder.

# Flat Icons

*Dashboard*

For Icons, I use the ultra-flat-icons theme. It is available in blue (recommended), orange and mint green colors. To install this, you can run the following commands


```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/icons
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons
```

Alternatively, you could also run `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-orange` OR `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-green`.

based on you color preference. I recommend these flat icons, but you can also look at **Numix** and **Flattr**.

Now press your super key, search for **Ubuntu Tweak** and fire it. Under the tweaks tab, there is an option for theme. Under that select the **Flatabulous** theme. Under the icon settings, select **ultra-flat-icons**. Restart your computer, and you should be good to go! You computer will look something like this after you *restart*.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Q. What is your Sublime Text theme ?**

**A.** My Sublime text theme is a port of [Brogrammer](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme) and [Numix](https://github.com/nauzethc/sublime-text-numix) themes, which I have tweaked a little using [this](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) awesome tool for better contrast and colors. My exact version can be found [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/dotfiles/blob/master/sublime/anmol.tmTheme).

[**Quentin Gerodel**](https://github.com/Swizz540) has also contributed a version for [Atom](https://atom.io), which can be found [here](https://github.com/Swizz540/atom-anmol-syntax).

**Q. Where can I find your wallpaper ?**

**Q. What are your terminal theme and settings ?**

**A.** I am presently using zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) configuration. For the colorscheme, I am using a modified version of the default tango colors, material colors and the one dark scheme.

My zsh config can be found [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/custom/themes/anmol.zsh-theme). This works if  you have powerline fonts installed and oh-my-zsh setup. All other dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/dotfiles).

[Here](https://gist.github.com/anmoljagetia/780945d542a27c6cf6e8) is a script that will add a new profile in gnome-terminal that mimics my terminal settings.

A one liner install can be done by running the command

```
wget -O xt http://git.io/vn6HM && chmod +x xt && ./xt && rm xt
```

I have my terminal set at 10% transparency. More cool color schemes can be found [here](https://terminal.sexy), for a variety of other terminals.
