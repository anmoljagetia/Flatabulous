#Flatabulous

This is a Flat theme for Ubuntu and other debian based Linux Systems.  This is based on a the Ultra-Flat theme. Special thanks to @steftrikia and Satyajit Sahoo for the original work.

This theme was designed *specially* for the Unity environment on Ubuntu as I have only tested it on Ubuntu. It might not work properly for the other versions.

*The terminal*

#Installation

First, install the theme by simply running the following commands in your console ( or Terminal ) :

```
    $ sudo su
    
    $ wget -qO- https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /usr/share/themes
```


To install the theme, you must first install the [**Ubuntu tweak tool**](http://ubuntu-tweak.com/). It can be installed by simply running the command :

```
1. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa
2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak
```

or heading over to there website, downloading the .deb file (recommended).



Then, you can download the source to the theme [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/archive/master.zip). If you are a developer or a designer, I also encourage you to contribute to it. Create a folder, called .theme in your home directory. This can be simply created by firing up your terminal, and then running

`mkdir .themes`

Now this is a hidden directory, to view this in Nautilus, you can press `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + H`.

#Flat Icons

*Dashboard*

For Icons, I use the ultra-flat-icons theme. It is available in blue (recommended), orange and mint green colors. To install this, you can run the following commands


```
1. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/icons
2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons
```

Alternatively, you could also run `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-orange` OR `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-green`.

based on you color preference. I recommend these flat icons, but you can also look at **Numix** and **Flattr**.

Now press your super key, search for **Ubuntu Tweak** and fire it. Under the tweaks tab, there is an option for theme. Under that select the **Flatabulous** theme. Under the icon settings, select **ultra-flat-icons**. Restart your computer, and you should be good to go! You computer will look something like this after you *restart*.
